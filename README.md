The game was developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.</br>
The game is controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard.</br>
For every x apples eaten, a golden apple is spawned in the game.</br>
Each golden apple provides a random bonus between 0 and 10 points.</br>
For every x golden apples eaten, an extra life is added.</br>
The extra life prevents the game from ending when the snake collides with itself.</br>
For every x apples eaten, a diamond apple is spawned.</br>
When a diamond apple is eaten, the snake's length is randomly reduced while maintaining the game score.</br>
The highest score achieved becomes the new record.</br>
